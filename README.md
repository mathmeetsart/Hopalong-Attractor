# Hopalong Attractor

Welcome to the Hopalong Attractor repository! Explore the mesmerizing world of chaotic dynamics and strange attractors.

## Description

The Hopalong Attractor is a fascinating chaotic system discovered by Barry Martin in the late 1970s. It is a two-dimensional dynamical system that generates beautiful and intricate patterns resembling fractals. The Hopalong Attractor is characterized by its non-linear equations that produce mesmerizing and unpredictable trajectories.
